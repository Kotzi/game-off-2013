## About the game

How much would you hurt the planet to get to the end?

[ChChChChChanges](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K78gvWXDgNM) is a simple platformer game where your goal is to reach the end of each level. To aid you, you can control several of the effects of our very real **climate changes**. Raise the water level, or melt glaciers to reach your goal.

But of course, messing with the planet is **bad**, isnt't it? How far can you get without destroying our home?
